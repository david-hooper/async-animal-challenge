# Async Animals Challenge

Fix the broken async calls so animals load in the right order and so the page does not take more than 3 seconds to load. 

DO NOT MODIFY backend.js

You can lanch frontend using live server for auto refreshes without having to restart node server. 



## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/david-hooper/async-animal-challenge.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd async-animal-challenge/backend_server/
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```
Server should be running on http://localhost:3000
